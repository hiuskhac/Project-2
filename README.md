# Landing Page Project

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

### This project has the following features

- Build the navigation menu:
  <p>This will dynamically create a navigation menu based on the sections of the page</p>
- Add functionality to distinguish the section in view:
  <p>While navigating through the page, the section that is active in the viewport/closest to the top should be distinguished from the other sections. More specifically, when dragging to the active section, add the active class to the corresponding section tag</p>
- Add the functionality to scroll to sections:
  <p>Clicking on a navigation item should scroll to the appropriate section of the page.</p>
